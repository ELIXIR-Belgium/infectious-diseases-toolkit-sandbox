## Introduction 
This page discusses infectious disease research in Norway and provides information on relevant health authorities and initiatives. In addition, the page offers a collection of key considerations for researchers such as regulations for data handling and disease control. While the primary target audience is the scientific community in Norway, you’ll also find open-access resources (e.g. on Research Data Management (RDM) topics) that could be useful for the wider community.

## Health Authorities in Norway
<!--- A section to list and provide context to agencies/authorities/institutions which define public health measures and policies --->
The [Norwegian Directorate of Health](https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/english) (Helsedirektoratet) and the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/) (Folkehelseinstituttet, referred to as FHI from here onwards) work jointly to provide an effective and coordinated effort towards the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The agencies also ensure that public health data is collected, stored, and shared in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The Directorate of Health monitors public health issues to develop national guidelines and strategies for surveillance, prevention, and response activities. Together with local health authorities and healthcare providers, the directorate implements relevant policies and communicates these guidelines to the public. The directorate coordinated the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic, establishing national recommendations for testing, tracing, and isolation.

FHI advises health authorities on public health issues, including disease prevention, outbreak control, and preparedness for national health emergencies. The institute works with the Directorate of Health to develop vaccination programs, guide infection control measures, and support healthcare providers and related institutions. The [Division of Infection Control](https://www.fhi.no/en/about/this-is-the-norwegian-institute-of-public-health/divisions/infection-control-environmental-health/) within FHI supports infectious disease research, monitors infectious disease outbreaks, and analyses data related to these outbreaks. During the recent pandemic, FHI published a [handbook for medical researchers](https://www.fhi.no/nettpub/overvaking-vurdering-og-handtering-av-covid-19-epidemien-i-kommunen/) to understand the handling of SARS-CoV-2 variants data.

## Disease surveillance initiatives
### Agencies
Several governmental organisations collaborate with FHI to monitor pathogenic data and support surveillance initiatives. 

The [Norwegian Environment Agency](https://www.environmentagency.no) ([Miljødirektoratet](https://www.miljodirektoratet.no)) oversees detection of pathogens in wastewater and tracks occurrences of antimicrobial resistance in natural areas and wild species.

The [Norwegian Food Safety Authority](https://www.mattilsynet.no/language/english/) (Mattilsynet) works towards ensuring the safety of food and drinking water in Norway.

### Research
The FHI maintains a [wastewater monitoring project](https://www.fhi.no/cristin-prosjekter/aktiv/avlopsovervaking-sars-cov-2/) to better understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The institute provides the latest results on their [Results from wastewater surveillance](https://www.fhi.no/en/hn/statistics/overvaking-smittsomme-sykdommer-i-avlopsvann/results-from-wastewater-surveillance/) page.

## National data sources
<!--- A section to list and provide context to national data sources. In the context of BY-COVID, a data source can be a repository which should include at least the metadata and ideally the data, that might not be directly available when considering sensitive data. Also, repositories should have the capacity to share this data and therefore have a governance model in place on how to do it. It can also include registries of data sources important for the field, with a direct link to the original data sources to be able to request access to the data. --->
The FHI operates three national electronic reporting systems that are involved in surveillance of infectious diseases. Healthcare providers and laboratories use the following three systems to register cases, allowing health authorities to access data in real-time:
* Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS)
* Norwegian Surveillance System for Antibiotic Use and Hospital-Acquired Infections (NOIS) 
* Norwegian Surveillance System for Viral Resistance (RAVN)

[MSIS](https://www.fhi.no/en/hn/health-registries/msis/) collects data on infectious diseases in Norway. The registry provides a comprehensive overview of the incidence, distribution, and trends of infectious diseases. FHI uses the data to monitor disease outbreaks, identify emerging threats, and evaluate the effectiveness of infectious disease control measures.

[NOIS](https://www.fhi.no/hn/helseregistre-og-registre/nois/) (in Norwegian) monitors the occurrence of hospital-acquired infections and tracks the use of antibiotics within Norwegian health services. Public health authorities use the registry to identify areas of concern within infection control measures to limit the spread of infections and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Because the registry contains information that could indirectly identify patients, researchers must apply for access to NOIS statistics and data:
* [Norwegian application (for applicants with a Norwegian electronic ID)](https://helsedata.no/no/forvaltere/folkehelseinstituttet/norsk-overvakingssystem-for-antibiotikabruk-og-helsetjenesteassosierte-infeksjoner-nois/)
* [English application](https://helsedata.no/en/forvaltere/norwegian-institute-of-public-health/norwegian-surveillance-system-for-antibiotic-use-and-healthcare-associated-infections-nois/)

[RAVN](https://www.fhi.no/en/hn/health-registries/norwegian-surveillance-system-for-virus-resistance-ravn/) tracks antiviral resistance to viruses that present a significant public health concern in Norway. Healthcare providers and local microbiological laboratories submit both suspected and confirmed cases for genotypic analysis and phenotypic resistance testing, typically at national reference laboratories.

## Regulations
The Section for Public Health within the [Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/hod/id421/) (Helse- og omsorgsdepartementet) oversees FHI and emergency preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks. The ministry’s Department of Health Legislation enacts regulations that provide a legal framework for disease outbreak response and other public health emergencies.

Norway introduced the infectious disease control act back in 1994; the act addresses various considerations such as health measures and risk assessments of infectious diseases for the prevention of  transmission. You can read the latest version of the act and learn more at: [Protection against infectious diseases act (Smittevernloven 1994)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1994-08-05-55) (in Norwegian). Past experiences with epidemics and pandemics have taught us that emergency preparations are absolutely necessary. That is where the [Health preparedness act (Helseberedskapsloven 2000)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2000-06-23-56) (in Norwegian) comes into the picture that addresses considerations for preparedness plans that could help health and care services, and legal authorities to control outbreaks of infectious diseases.

The recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemic brought new challenges for the country that resulted in establishing new regulations, for example, for quarantine rules and administration of vaccinations. The new regulations were published as changes to the infectious disease control act and health preparedness act, read  more at: [Changes to reflect handling the coronavirus pandemic (2021)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/LTI/lov/2021-11-29-143) (in Norwegian).

The [Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet)](https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/) is an independent body that oversees the processing of personal data in Norway, including data related to public health and infectious disease outbreaks. Datatilsynet upholds compliance with Norwegian data protection laws and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. The regulations for sensitive/personal research and clinical data, in Norway, are implemented in [Health Research Act (Helseforskningsloven)](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2008-06-20-44?q=helseforskningsloven)

When it comes to scientific research, [Norges Forskningsråd (Research Council of Norway)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/) has a [policy that requires open access to research data (revised 2017)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/siteassets/publikasjoner/1254032622112.pdf). You can read more about the importance of open science and find useful resources at the following link https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/.
