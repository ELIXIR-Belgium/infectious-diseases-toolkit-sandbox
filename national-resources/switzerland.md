## Introduction 
<!---General Infectious diseases data considerations for your country--->

Do we have in Switzerland a general, common way or place where people can find information about RDM for infectious diseases?

More about vaccines and how the information is collected, organised in CH?

## Health authorities
<!--- A section to list and provide context to agencies/authorities/institutions which define public health measures and policies --->
Switzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons. Switzerland's health system is highly decentralized, with significant responsibility for public health measures and policies resting with the country's cantons. The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) is responsible for coordinating national health policies, but the cantons have a high degree of autonomy in implementing these policies.

The FOPH plays a critical role in setting national public health goals and guidelines, overseeing the country's health insurance system, and coordinating responses to public health emergencies. The FOPH also manages national health registries and monitors health indicators, such as disease incidence rates and vaccination coverage. FOPH may also require laboratories, health care institutions and other institutions of the cantons to communicate their stocks of therapeutic products, protective equipment and other medical goods important for the maintenance of health care capacities (important medical goods).

In addition to the FOPH, there are several other agencies and institutions involved in shaping public health policy in Switzerland. These include the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences, and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, among others.

Switzerland also participates in international public health organisations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which provide guidance and support for public health measures at the national and international level.

In March 2020, the Swiss Federal Council declared a state of emergency and announced a series of measures to control the spread of the virus restricting the cantons’ power of decision. Country's extensive network of laboratories ramped up testing capacity to identify new cases. The data were collected by the laboratories and fed into the SPSP platform, which allowed the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health to have and provide regular updates on the outbreak, and issued guidance to the public on how to prevent the spread of the virus. The government also launched a contact tracing app to help identify potential COVID-19 cases and prevent further transmission. 

Since the return to a normal situation, responsibility for measures to protect the population has moved back to the cantons. The measures can therefore differ from one canton to the next.

## Disease surveillance initiatives

Switzerland has a well-established disease surveillance system that plays a critical role in monitoring and responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Here are some of the key disease surveillance initiatives in Switzerland:
Sentinel surveillance: Switzerland has a sentinel surveillance system for monitoring a range of infectious diseases, including influenza, respiratory infections, and sexually transmitted infections. The system involves a network of healthcare providers who report data on disease incidence and trends. Reporting system for Infectious diseases:

Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit: The Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU) is a national survey system to document rare paediatric pathologies and rare complications of more common diseases by children treated in hospitals in Switzerland.

National Notification System: The National Notification System requires healthcare providers to report cases of certain infectious diseases to the FOPH. This system enables the FOPH to track the spread of diseases, identify outbreaks, and initiate public health responses.

Laboratory surveillance: Switzerland has an extensive network of laboratories that are involved in disease surveillance, including the National Reference Centers for Influenza and Emerging Viruses. These laboratories conduct diagnostic tests and monitor trends in disease activity.

Travel health surveillance: Switzerland also has a system for monitoring the health of travelers, particularly those returning from high-risk areas. The system involves screening travelers for symptoms of infectious diseases and providing them with information and guidance on how to prevent the spread of disease.

Global health surveillance: Switzerland is also involved in global disease surveillance initiatives, including the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). GOARN is a global network of public health experts who respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases around the world.

How are all these connected, related? Is there a single institution (FOPH) that glues all these initiatives together?
Overall, Switzerland's disease surveillance initiatives involve a range of stakeholders, including healthcare providers, laboratories, and public health agencies. These initiatives are critical for detecting and responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases and protecting public health.

## Dashboards and visualisation platforms
May have an overlap with the session below (national data sources), but we can try to avoid…

## National data sources
<!--- A section to list and provide context to national data sources. In the context of BY-COVID, a data source can be a repository which should include at least the metadata and ideally the data, that might not be directly available when considering sensitive data. Also, repositories should have the capacity to share this data and therefore have a governance model in place on how to do it. It can also include registries of data sources important for the field, with a direct link to the original data sources to be able to request access to the data. --->

Registries and databases, with a text to give the context: how they are related and complement each other.

## Regulations
<!--- Ethical and legal regulations in the country, committees etc --->
The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences is an independent institution that provides guidance on ethical issues in medicine and healthcare. It develops guidelines and recommendations for medical professionals, policymakers, and the public.

The Swiss National Ethics Committee is an independent advisory body that provides guidance on ethical issues in science and medicine. It advises policymakers and researchers on issues related to human rights, social justice, and scientific integrity.

Overall, Switzerland has a robust system of institutions responsible for making ethical and legal regulations in different areas, including healthcare, science, and law. These institutions work together to ensure that ethical and legal considerations are taken into account in decision-making processes.


## Domain-specific infrastructures or resources 
<!--- e.g. human data, covid-19. Please, only add domain-specific resources that you think don't fit in the table at the bottom--->

SPHN?

S3C ? the Swiss SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Consortium was until the end of 2022 the largest SARS-Cov-2 sequencing effort in Switzerland. Together with multiple diagnostic labs and sequencing centres, they have established a workflow for the surveillance of up to thousands of samples per week. Information on these samples is shared within a short turnaround time with the FOPH and also with GISAID and ENA with the help of SPSP. 

Wastewater initiatives?
