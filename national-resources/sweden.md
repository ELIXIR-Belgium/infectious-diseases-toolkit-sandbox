## Introduction 
This page provides a general overview of resources, tools and data related to the management of infectious disease data in Sweden. Given the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many of the resources featured here are centered around COVID-19. However, the practices, regulations, and other resources on this page can be repurposed for use with other pathogens.

Support for research data management (RDM) both for infectious disease data, and more generally, can be obtained from National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS) and the Data Centre at Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab). The two have a [shared data management helpdesk](data-management@scilifelab.se) for providing direct support. In addition, research data offices (RDOs) or Data Access Unit (DAU)(https://data-guidelines.scilifelab.se/topics/university-rdm-resources/) situated at most Swedish universities offer general RDM support. 

## Health authorities
<!--- A section to list and provide context to agencies/authorities/institutions which define public health measures and policies --->

There are three main health authorities in Sweden that determine public health policy, and the measures that should be taken to protect public health. All are government authorities with different responsibilities. 

- **[The Swedish Medical Products Agency(Läkemedelsverket)](https://www.lakemedelsverket.se/en)**   is responsible for the approval of prescription medications and vaccinations, as well as for monitoring their efficacy and safety after approval. It also approves and controls clinical trials. 
 
- **[The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten, FoHM)](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/)** is responsible for monitoring public health issues in Sweden. It collects and aggregates [statistics related to the effect of infectious diseases on public health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/folkhalsorapportering-statistik/statistik-a-o/sjukdomsstatistik/) (e.g. the number of cases and hospitalisations resulting from a given pathogen). 

- [**The National Board for Health and  Welfare (Socialstyrelsen)**](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/) is responsible for issuing guidelines and regulations related to public health. It also maintains multiple [clinical registers](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/statistics-and-data/registers/) and [statistics on COVID-19](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-on-covid-19/).

## Disease surveillance initiatives

Multiple initiatives have been established for disease surveillance in Sweden. Below we give examples of ongoing initiatives. These initiatives generally monitor a broad range of pathogens.

### Wastewater surveillance

Wastewater surveillance has proven to be an effective means of predicting outbreaks, with peaks in viral genome content shown to precede increases in cases and hopitalisations (see e.g. [Wang *et al.* (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36035197/)
) .

Multiple research groups across Sweden have undertaken surveillance including groups at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), and [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)](https://www.slu.se/en/). These efforts largely focused on monitoring SARS-CoV-2 throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since expanded to include other pathogens. More information on the work by these groups is on the [Swedish COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/wastewater/).

### Sentinel monitoring in healthcare

The Swedish Public Health Agency coordinates [sentinel monitoring](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/mikrobiologi-laboratorieanalyser/mikrobiella-och-immunologiska-overvakningsprogram/sentinelovervakning/) for COVID-19 and influenza. In sentinel monitoring, samples are taken from patients with symptoms of influenza or acute respiratory infections. These samples are analysed by [the Swedish Public Health Agency](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/). 

The data is then used to inform national policy decisions, and is reported to the public, before being subsequently reported to the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en). ECDC then reports the date to the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://www.who.int/). 

## Dashboards and visualisation platforms

- [SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests conducted by the SciLifeLab Autoimmunity and Serology profiling facility]( https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/serology-statistics/): The dashboard shows the total number of tests conducted, as well as the number of positive and negative tests over time.

- [Wastewater monitoring by research groups in Sweden](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/wastewater/): The dashboard shows data about the levels of viral genome in wastewater in multiple Swedish cities over time.
- [Administration of COVID-19 vaccinations in Sweden](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/vaccines/): The dashboard shows vaccine coverage in terms of different doses, different regions, and different age groups.
- [Register-based large-scale national population study to monitor COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness and safety](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/dashboards/recovac/): The dashboard shows registry based data related to how vaccination coverage with different doses related to the number of cases and admissions to intensive care units (ICU). It examines different age groups within the whole Swedish population, and different risk categories.

### National Pandemic Centre (NPC)
The [National Pandemic Centre](https://ki.se/en/mtc/national-pandemic-centre-npc) (NPC) is a research facility located at [Karolinska Institute](https://ki.se/)/[SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/). It is responsible for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 variants in Sweden, and collaborates with multiple Swedish regional health agencies and the Swedish Public Health Agency to collect samples and distribute data accordingly. 

### Biobank Sweden (Biobank Sverige)

[Biobank Sweden](https://biobanksverige.se/en/home/), is a national infrastructure for biobanking. The infrastructure facilitates and promotes collaborations between healthcare, academia, industry, and patient organisations. It is the Swedish node of [BBMRI-ERIC](https://www.bbmri-eric.eu/), a European biobanking research infrastructure. 

Biobank Sweden has the responsibility for maintaining a Regional Biobank Centre in each of the six healthcare regions in Sweden. Biobank Sverige has collaborated with the Swedish COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal to generate the [COVID-19 sample collections database](https://biobanks.covid19dataportal.se/). 

The database shows which collections of samples are available from different biobanks across Sweden, as well as metadata about the collections such as the size of the collection and the conditions for access.

### Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS)

[*Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS)*](https://genomicmedicine.se/), is a samarbetsorgan founded in 2018. It aims to enable genomic innovation to be translated into clinical practice, and to provide a sustainable precision medicine infrastructure. 

[Infectious disease](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/infectious-diseases/) is one of the seven disease areas covered by GMS. In late 2022, an [agreement for data sharing](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/2022/12/07/national-it-infrastructure-in-operation-to-share-genomics-data-across-healthcare-regions-in-sweden/) was signed between GMS’s partners, seven regions and seven universities across Sweden. The agreement enables healthcare data, including genomics data, to be shared across Sweden for the first time.

### Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness program

The [*Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness (PLP) program*](https://www.scilifelab.se/capabilities/pandemic-laboratory-preparedness/) is a SciLifeLab research program. SciLifeLab was commissioned by the Swedish government to build laboratory capacity to ensure future pandemic preparedness. Specifically, to build capacity to be able to assist through research, competence, and technology development. 

As of 2023, the program includes 21 projects (including both research and technical development projects), a network of clinical laboratories, and collaborations with multiple infrastructure and governmental agencies (e.g. the [Swedish public health agency (FoHM)](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/)). 

The data from the program is shared on [The Swedish COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Data Portal] (https://pandemicpreparednessportal.se), as is a [greater level of detail about each research and technology development project](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/resources/).

### Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)

[*Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)*](http://www.cbcs.se/) is a SciLifeLab national research infrastructure (i.e. a national infrastructure unit that is funded by SciLifelab). The CBCS enables researchers to find and develop small molecules to understand and decipher the function of biological pathways, including those associated with infectious disease.
